## FAQs
**Q: Why did we build this?**

A: In the spirit of the open source ecosystem and towards the goal of delighting our customers, we are completely transparent with our roadmap. We want to provide our customers the opportunity to understand better how we work, how decisions were made, and what priorities we have.

**Q: Why are there no dates on our roadmap?**

A: Our primary focus is on security and operational stability. As such, we can't provide specific target dates for features.

**Q: What do the roadmap categories mean?**

A: We have 5 columns in order to allow us to be very clear on the stages of the development process:

- **Under consideration:**
This lists the features we are thinking about. We have not committed to them yet, since we are still checking with our customers, upstream and the market as a whole.

- **In design:**
These are features we know we want to build and are thinking about how to build them well.

- **Ready to develop:**
At this stage we know what we want to build and how we plan to build it. These features are next up to be allocated to development teams.

- **In development:**
This is our construction site and you get a clear view of what it is that we are building at the moment.

- **Shipped:**
Congratulations! The feature is now available to you. Let us know what you think.

**Q: Are all our plans and projects on the roadmap?**

A: Typicaly yes. Please note, that things may move around, we may do things we didn't list and cancel things that we planned.
We track postmortems and security related issues separately and don't include them in the Roadmap.

**Q: How can I provide feedback or ask for more information?**

A: We encourage you to comment and provide feedback on the issues themselves.

**Q: How can I request a feature be added to the roadmap?**

A: Please open an issue! Please only use [Feature Request](https://github.com/giantswarm/roadmap/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature-request&template=feature_request.md&title=) template for submitting your ideas. Community submitted issues will be tagged "Feature-request" and will be reviewed by the team.
