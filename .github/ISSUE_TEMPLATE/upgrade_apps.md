Notes
* Team divides the app upgrades amongst ourselves. Please add @ name beside the app
* [30 Day Upgrade Promise](https://intranet.giantswarm.io/docs/product/pdr/003_30-day-upgrade-promise/): By default, we upgrade our apps within 30 days of an upstream release. We know that falling behind releases and putting upgrades off for extended amounts of time, especially when thereâ€™s breaking changes, almost always comes back to bite us.
* Engineer can override this default and decide not to upgrade with good reason.
